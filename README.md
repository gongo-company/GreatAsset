# Great Asset

## Installation

Use r2modmanplus to install from the thunderstore or put the BepInEx folder into your plugins folder like any other mod.

## Overview

Makes your character say "Great asset!" when you use the point emote.
The pitch will randomize sometimes when you walk. I'm not fixing it because it's funny.
